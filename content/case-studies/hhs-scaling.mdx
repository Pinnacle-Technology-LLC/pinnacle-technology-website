*A universal metadata infrastructure that unifies and connects datasets across platforms — enabling discovery, enrichment, and data redirection.*

## Challenge

Public data platforms operate in silos, each maintaining their own metadata standards, update schedules, and publishing rules. This fragmentation makes it difficult for agencies and civic data programs to maintain consistent visibility across datasets or ensure their information stays current.

Many organizations are also constrained by staffing or system limitations that make it hard to scale metadata publishing, even when their data is public and valuable.

## Our Approach

We designed a **universal metadata ingestion and enrichment system** that connects to any public data source — automatically harvesting, normalizing, and monitoring datasets for updates or new publications.

The platform's **metadata-first architecture** allows clients to maintain high-quality, discoverable records without duplicating data storage or creating version drift. When a source changes, the system detects it, enriches the metadata, and synchronizes the update to our **universal catalog**, ensuring downstream clients always stay current.

Key capabilities include:

* **Multi-source ingestion:** Connect to open data portals, APIs, and registries across government, research, and civic platforms.
* **Metadata enrichment:** Harmonize source metadata against DCAT and client-specific domain schemas (e.g., Socrata, OpenGov).
* **Change monitoring:** Automatically detect new or modified datasets and refresh client records.
* **Optional dataset ingestion:** Support full dataset processing for previews, validation, or cross-platform publishing.
* **Interoperability:** Maintain compliance with DCAT, ISO 19115, and schema.org/DataCatalog for long-term compatibility.

## Results

We recently deployed **15,000 metadata-only datasets** for a federal health agency, demonstrating the system's scalability and standards alignment. These metadata records serve as lightweight "dataless datasets" — enriched entries that describe and link to authoritative data sources, giving users discovery and routing without replication.

This implementation proved the platform's ability to:

* Rapidly onboard and normalize large data inventories.
* Ensure metadata accuracy and traceability through automated validation.
* Deliver interoperable catalogs compatible with existing government data ecosystems.

## Looking Ahead

The Universal Data Catalog extends beyond a single client or platform — it represents the foundation for a **metadata-driven data ecosystem**. By continuously monitoring public sources and syncing updates into a unified schema, it enables any organization to maintain an always-fresh, standards-compliant view of the public data landscape.

This project demonstrates our capability to build data systems that start strong and scale reliably, with governance and quality baked in from day one.
