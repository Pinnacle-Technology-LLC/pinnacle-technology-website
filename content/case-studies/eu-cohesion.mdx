*A trusted partner for the European Commission — serving as the sole development team for a mission-critical transparency portal that delivers budget data for all 27 EU member states with exceptional reliability.*

## Challenge

The European Commission needed a dependable team to maintain and enhance their Cohesion Open Data platform — a public transparency portal providing access to billions of euros in EU budget allocations across multiple funding periods and all member states.

The platform serves diverse stakeholders including citizens, researchers, journalists, and policymakers, requiring consistent uptime, careful coordination across multiple EU directorates, and ongoing feature development while maintaining data integrity and European Commission compliance standards.

This engagement demanded more than technical competence — it required a partner who could deliver predictable results, prevent incidents before they occur, and evolve the platform to meet growing transparency needs across the European Union.

## Our Approach

We became the sole development and maintenance team for the platform in January 2023, taking full responsibility for reliability, feature delivery, and continuous improvement.

Our approach centers on proactive quality and sustainable operations:

* **Incident prevention first** — Comprehensive monitoring, automated testing, and validation processes that catch issues before they reach users, delivering zero priority incidents over 16+ months.
* **Predictable release cadence** — Consistent quarterly delivery schedule with careful change management, ensuring new features arrive without disruption to critical operations.
* **User-centered enhancement** — Accessibility improvements, streamlined navigation, and comprehensive documentation serving diverse audiences across all 27 member states.
* **Automated data operations** — Daily data refresh pipelines ensuring budget information stays current and accurate without manual intervention.
* **Cross-directorate coordination** — Transparent communication and collaborative planning with multiple EU units, maintaining alignment on priorities and timelines.
* **Modern platform architecture** — Fast, responsive experience across desktop and mobile devices, with complex visualizations (Sankey charts, interactive maps) that make budget data accessible and understandable.

## Results

We've delivered exceptional reliability and continuous value over 2+ years of partnership:

**Reliability & Scale**
* Zero priority-one incidents across 16+ months of operation
* 99.9%+ uptime ensuring continuous public access
* 48+ releases delivered on schedule across multiple quarters
* 27 country-specific implementations serving every EU member state
* Hundreds of datasets managed across 25+ years of funding periods (2000-2027)

**User Impact**
* Faster navigation and improved access to country and fund-specific data
* Enhanced accessibility serving diverse audiences including citizens, researchers, and policymakers
* Better visualizations making complex budget allocations easier to understand
* Daily automated updates keeping transparency data current and trustworthy

**Institutional Value**
