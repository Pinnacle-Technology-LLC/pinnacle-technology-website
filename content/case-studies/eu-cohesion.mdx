*A trusted partner in transparency, scale, and long-term platform stewardship.*

### **Overview**

We serve as the sole development and maintenance team for the **European Commission's Cohesion Open Data Platform**, a mission-critical transparency portal that provides access to EU budget allocations for all 27 member states. This high-impact platform enables public insight into billions of euros in funding—supporting democratic accountability, evidence-based policymaking, and long-term institutional transparency.

Since January 2023, our team has been responsible for ensuring the platform's reliability, performance, and continuous evolution to meet growing demand across Europe.

---

### **The Challenge**

The European Commission needed a dependable technical partner to maintain and enhance a complex, multilingual open data portal used by:

* **Citizens** seeking transparency
* **Policymakers** driving regional development
* **Journalists and researchers** analyzing EU investments

The platform supports data spanning **25+ years of funding periods**, across **multiple directorates**, and must meet strict **European Commission compliance, accessibility, and uptime standards**.

This engagement demanded more than engineering skills—it required strategic collaboration, operational excellence, and a relentless focus on stability and trust.

---

### **Our Approach**

We built a sustainable, user-centered, and incident-preventative operation focused on delivering continuous value:

* **Incident prevention first**
  Proactive monitoring, automated testing, and validation pipelines have resulted in **zero priority-one incidents** across 16+ months.

* **Predictable release cadence**
  Delivered **48+ on-schedule quarterly releases** with zero disruption to operations.

* **User-focused enhancements**
  Improved accessibility, refined UX, and expanded multilingual support to meet the needs of users across all 27 EU member states.

* **Automated data operations**
  Daily refresh pipelines keep billions in EU budget data accurate and up to date—no manual intervention required.

* **Cross-directorate coordination**
  Regular collaboration with multiple EU institutions ensures alignment with strategic priorities and compliance needs.

* **Modern platform architecture**
  Responsive design, intuitive navigation, and complex data visualizations (Sankey charts, interactive maps) make the platform both informative and engaging.
